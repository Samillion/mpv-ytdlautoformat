# mpv-ytdlautoformat
This is a very simple script to automatically change the `ytdl-format` for specific sources, Youtube and Twitch. The script changes quality to 480p, 30FPS and no VP9.

This can be adjusted easily, whether you want it to be 720p or 1080p, within the script.

# Known issues
The script runs smoothely if the URL is `youtube.com` or `twitch.tv`, however my pattern fails to match `youtu.be` domain, which is something I'll hopefully figure out soon.
